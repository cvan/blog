Watching an episode of the hilarious [_Modern Family_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437/), I was reminded of that warm feeling I used to get from watching movies, films, cinema. Specifically, from the [French New Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave), _La Nouvelle Vague_.

Just the other day, I opened [MUBI](https://mubi.com/), a streaming movie service I use (think Netflix for cinephiles aka film snobs). This black-and-white American "indie" [dramedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy-drama) film from 1953 caught my eye: [_Little Fugitive_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046004/). There was even a testimonial by French New Wave filmmaker [François Truffaut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut):

> Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way with his fine movie _Little Fugitive_.

Watching French New Wave cinema — especially the works of Jean-Luc Godard and Agnès Varda — has been a deeply emotional and satisfying experience for me. For the same reasons I adore Wes Anderson's films (which were unsurprisingly inspired by the New Wave), these films were subtly funny, intentionally unpolished, nuanced, and — above all — pretentious. One summer in particular, I fell in love with Godard films, watching one after another lying in bed in corporate housing during a summer internship. My roommate thought I was totally normal.

What attracted me to these films? The pretension? The gritty aesthetic? The high-brow dialogue? The subtitles? The cult following? The "sophisticated" humour? The self-reflexive style? The existential themes? The attention to detail? The mise en scène? The historical significance? Romanticisation with the culture and the time period? The fact that I noticed the voiceovers, the jump cuts, the overhead shots, the tracking shots? Was I deeply invested and moved by the films because of my attachment to or loyalty to Godard as an auteur? Was this art that only I __appreciated__? Were there details only I __noticed__? Were these moments of self inquiry and introspection only things I __experienced__?

I ask myself why I have never felt this level of intimacy with a television program, no matter how polished or original it may be.

Is it because television is culturally positioned as a lower art form — a cheap and accessible entertainment vehicle for the uninspired masses? Is there a simple explanation for my deep identification with French New Wave cinema — or cinema in general, for that matter? Is it the duration, the absence of a laugh track, the visual space, the very deliberate capture and framing of items in a moving picture?

With the exception of _Seinfeld_, I've realised that most of my favourite television programs feel very cinematic (_Bored to Death_, _The Mindy Project_, _Party Down_) or are presented in a mockumentary/fly-on-the-wall format (_Arrested Development_, _The Office_ circa seasons 1–3).

Perhaps television should mimic cinema (or just [cut those darn laugh tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs)).

Perhaps we should all just watch cinema (or just Godard).

Perhaps I'm just pretentious (or you just don't get it).
