Is it possible to have an interest, goal, job, project, or idea without complete identification?

Outward recognition/imaging and pride thrive on dopamine chasing. "I am a listener of underground hip-hop music," or "I am an inventor of this programming technique," I tell myself.

We lie to ourselves, chase the wrong things, not knowing what or whom to pursue or let go. Start by watching yourself. As honestly as you can. It can be hard. But you want to be able to look back knowing you experienced a life fulfilled, not just a life completed.
