Try to find an exercise you can incorporate into your morning routine. You should be able to do it in under a few minutes. Strive for consistency and good feeling. <span class="more"></span> For me, that's at least 20 military pushups. Some consistent number of pushups that I must do before I shower. And I feel good about it. No need to guilt myself that I haven't been to the gym or biked to work recently. Only pride that I am being consistently active and therefore getting progressively more fit.

What's your MVE?
