I learn coding patterns by examples. Not blog posts. Not videos. Sometimes documentation. But more often it is through out-in-the-wild code samples.

<span class="more"></span>

Let's use [_Framer Motion_](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) as an example. Its npm project is called ([`framer-motion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion)).

To learn from how other folks are using `framer-motion`, I regularly peruse code samples I've found from searching like this:

- [search **grep.app** for `framer-motion`, filtered by JavaScript language](https://grep.app/search?q=framer-motion&filter[lang][0]=JavaScript)
- [advanced search on GitHub of code for repositories with `package.json` files containing `framer-motion` as a dependency](https://github.com/search?l=&q=framer-motion+filename%3Apackage.json&type=Code)
- [peruse projects published on `npm` that depend on `framer-motion`](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/framer-motion)
- [search Google for `site:github.com framer-motion -inurl:framer/motion`](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+framer-motion+-inurl%3Aframer%2Fmotion)
- [search Google for `site:gist.github.com framer-motion`](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agist.github.com+framer-motion)

Hope that helps. Happy sleuthing!
