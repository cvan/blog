# Survey Interfaces

## The dilemma

I want to watch a film.

I want to watch it now.

I want it to make me laugh.

I don't want it to stress me out.

I want it to be reminscient of Wes Anderson or French New Wave films.

I want it to be released in the past few decade.

I try [Netflix](http://netflix.com/). Searching isn't cutting it. Browsing isn't cutting it. "Related Titles" isn't cutting it.

I try [instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com/). Nope.

I try [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/). Nope.

I try [Jinni](http://www.jinni.com/). Closer.

I try [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/). Nope. They have an [advanced search](http://www.imdb.com/search/) which is neat, but I gave up on it.

Now that I've found a film I want to watch, how do I find it?

I try [Where to Watch](http://wheretowatch.org/) and [GoWatchIt](http://gowatchit.com/).


## Don't make me classify

Search filters try to solve this, but they don't.

If I want to laugh, I can filter by the comedy genre. But if I don't want to be stressed out, what does that really man? The film should have no blood, no family drama, no relationship issues, no severe loss? As a filmgoer I don't know how to classify that, and even if I did, I don't want to spend the time to do so.

What other options do we have?

Survey interfaces.

Instead of having your users translate their desires into your terminology, ask them in their terminology.

"Do you want to be stressed out?"

If a user answers no, then the system should exclude such words:

* cancer
* illness
* assassination
* warfare
* murder
* brutality
* serial killer
* homicide
* pistol

And so forth. Don't misinterpret a user's not wanting to be stressed out as wanting to watch only comedies.

IMDb has [plot keywords](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/keywords).

Google wants to solve this problem.
