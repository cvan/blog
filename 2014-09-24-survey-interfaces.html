<h1>Survey Interfaces</h1>
<h2>The dilemma</h2>
<p>I want to watch a film.</p>
<p>I want to watch it now.</p>
<p>I want it to make me laugh.</p>
<p>I don't want it to stress me out.</p>
<p>I want it to be reminscient of Wes Anderson or French New Wave films.</p>
<p>I want it to be released in the past few decade.</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. Searching isn't cutting it. Browsing isn't cutting it. "Related Titles" isn't cutting it.</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/">instantwatcher.com</a>. Nope.</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Nope.</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://www.jinni.com/">Jinni</a>. Closer.</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>. Nope. They have an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/">advanced search</a> which is neat, but I gave up on it.</p>
<p>Now that I've found a film I want to watch, how do I find it?</p>
<p>I try <a href="http://wheretowatch.org/">Where to Watch</a> and <a href="http://gowatchit.com/">GoWatchIt</a>.</p>
<h2>Don't make me classify</h2>
<p>Search filters try to solve this, but they don't.</p>
<p>If I want to laugh, I can filter by the comedy genre. But if I don't want to be stressed out, what does that really man? The film should have no blood, no family drama, no relationship issues, no severe loss? As a filmgoer I don't know how to classify that, and even if I did, I don't want to spend the time to do so.</p>
<p>What other options do we have?</p>
<p>Survey interfaces.</p>
<p>Instead of having your users translate their desires into your terminology, ask them in their terminology.</p>
<p>"Do you want to be stressed out?"</p>
<p>If a user answers no, then the system should exclude such words:</p>
<ul>
<li>cancer</li>
<li>illness</li>
<li>assassination</li>
<li>warfare</li>
<li>murder</li>
<li>brutality</li>
<li>serial killer</li>
<li>homicide</li>
<li>pistol</li>
</ul>
<p>And so forth. Don't misinterpret a user's not wanting to be stressed out as wanting to watch only comedies.</p>
<p>IMDb has <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/keywords">plot keywords</a>.</p>
<p>Google wants to solve this problem.</p></article>
