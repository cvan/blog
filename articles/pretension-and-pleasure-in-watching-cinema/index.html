            <section class="content"><p>Watching an episode of the hilarious <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437/"><em>Modern Family</em></a>, I was reminded of that warm feeling I used to get from watching movies, films, cinema. Specifically, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave">French New Wave</a>, <em>La Nouvelle<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Vague</em>.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Just the other day, I opened <a href="https://mubi.com/"><span class="caps">MUBI</span></a>, a streaming movie service I use (think Netflix for cinephiles aka film snobs). This black-and-white American “indie” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy-drama">dramedy</a> film from 1953 caught my eye: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046004/"><em>Little Fugitive</em></a>. There was even a testimonial by French New Wave filmmaker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn’t been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way with his fine movie <em>Little<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Fugitive</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching French New Wave cinema — especially the works of Jean-Luc Godard and Agnès Varda — has been a deeply emotional and satisfying experience for me. For the same reasons I adore Wes Anderson’s films (which were unsurprisingly inspired by the New Wave), these films were subtly funny, intentionally unpolished, nuanced, and — above all — pretentious. One summer in particular, I fell in love with Godard films, watching one after another lying in bed in corporate housing during a summer internship. My roommate thought I was totally<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>normal.</p>
<p>What attracted me to these films? The pretension? The gritty aesthetic? The high-brow dialogue? The subtitles? The cult following? The “sophisticated” humour? The self-reflexive style? The existential themes? The attention to detail? The mise en scène? The historical significance? Romanticisation with the culture and the time period? The fact that I noticed the voiceovers, the jump cuts, the overhead shots, the tracking shots? Was I deeply invested and moved by the films because of my attachment to or loyalty to Godard as an auteur? Was this art that only I <strong>appreciated</strong>? Were there details only I <strong>noticed</strong>? Were these moments of self inquiry and introspection only things I <strong>experienced</strong>?</p>
<p>I ask myself why I have never felt this level of intimacy with a television program, no matter how polished or original it may<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>be.</p>
<p>Is it because television is culturally positioned as a lower art form — a cheap and accessible entertainment vehicle for the uninspired masses? Is there a simple explanation for my deep identification with French New Wave cinema — or cinema in general, for that matter? Is it the duration, the absence of a laugh track, the visual space, the very deliberate capture and framing of items in a moving<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>picture?</p>
<p>With the exception of <em>Seinfeld</em>, I’ve realised that most of my favourite television programs feel very cinematic (<em>Bored to Death</em>, <em>The Mindy Project</em>, <em>Party Down</em>) or are presented in a mockumentary/fly-on-the-wall format (<em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>The Office</em> circa seasons<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>1–3).</p>
<p>Perhaps television should mimic cinema (or just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs">cut those darn laugh tracks</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps we should all just watch cinema (or just<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Godard).</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m just pretentious (or you just don’t get<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it).</p>
