<h2 id="forgiving-inputs">Forgiving inputs</h2>
<p>Don’t make the user do string replacing and pattern matching. That’s something the application can do<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>instead.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, a site asks for a phone number with a specific pattern: a string prefixed with a <code>+</code> followed by 10 digits. If I enter <code>650 555 1212</code>, the application should be smart<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>enough</p>
<ul>
<li>to strip any non-numeric character (e.g., spaces, dots, hyphens, parentheses, slashes),<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>and</li>
<li>to automatically prefix with a common default (<code>+1</code> for a site with mostly <span class="caps">US</span> visitors, <code>+44</code> for a site with mostly German<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>visitors).</li>
</ul>
<p>(I actually reported this issue to Authy, with these recommendations, and they said they couldn’t fix<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.)</p>
<h2 id="catching-mistakes">Catching mistakes</h2>
<p>When requesting a ride from Uber, the application guesses and prefills your pickup location. Often times this is wrong, especially in apartment complexes and city streets near tall<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>buildings.</p>
<p>As such, I’ve gotten into the habit of manually entering my pickup location. The next screen asks for your dropoff<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>location.</p>
<p>On more than two occasions, I misentered my pickup as my dropoff location. I would then have to cancel my Uber ride, resulting in a $5 cancellation fee (and usually a confused<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>driver).</p>
<p>I realise many will say it’s my mistake for not reading things closely. It’s my opinion that the application should be resilient, forgiving, and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>intelligent.</p>
<p>After entering your pickup and dropoff locations, the application could easily check your relative distance from each location and then display a confirmation warning if things look<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>suspicious.</p>
<p>(I also reported this issue to Uber, with this recommendation, and they said they would keep it in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mind.)</p>
<hr>

<p>Don’t punish your users for just wanting to use your app and get on with their lives. Forgive them, and they’ll forgive you. Your users aren’t perfect, and neither is your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>app.</p>
