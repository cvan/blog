# Installation

You should use [`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). If you don't have that installed, do that now:

    sudo easy_install pip

Now to install Markdown, the single dependency:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


# Composing

1. Place a Markdown (`.md`) file in the `drafts` directory.
2. Compose.


# Publishing

1. Move the Markdown file from the `drafts` directory to the root directory.
2. Then to generate a static HTML file (e.g., `2014-07-04-post.html` for `2014-07-04-post.md`):

    _ 2014-07-04-post.md

3. Publish.
